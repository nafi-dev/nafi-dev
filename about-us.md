# About Us

Nafi Dev is a technology company founded by **NatÃ¡lia Andrade** and **Filipe Danielski Andrade**, combining deep expertise in **frontend and full-stack development**. We specialize in **building custom component libraries, scalable web applications, and modern UI solutions**, with a strong focus on **performance, maintainability, and developer experience**.

We believe that _off-the-rack works, but tailored fits best_. Just like a tailor crafts clothing to perfectly fit the individual, we create **custom software solutions** designed to meet each project's unique needs. Instead of forcing generic tools to adapt, **we build from the ground up**, ensuring seamless integration, optimal performance, and a flawless user experience.

With over a decade of experience, **Filipe** brings extensive knowledge in **Laravel, PHP, Vue.js, API development, and DevOps**, having worked on **ERP systems, fintech integrations, and large-scale governmental projects**. His expertise in **backend architecture, database management, and cloud deployments** ensures that our solutions are robust and scalable.

**NatÃ¡lia**, with a strong background in **Vue.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**, has led **UI/UX modernization projects, component-driven design systems, and style guide implementations**. Her experience spans **real-time messaging platforms, chatbot builders, and custom frontend solutions**, ensuring that every interface we create is **highly responsive, accessible, and visually polished**.

At **Nafi Dev**, we believe in **clean code, automation, and continuous learning**, allowing us to **deliver high-quality, efficient, and scalable solutions tailored to our clients' needs**. Our mission is to **bridge the gap between frontend and backend**, ensuring seamless integrations and **tailor-made software that fits like a glove**â€”providing the **best performance, comfort, and flexibility** for every project.
