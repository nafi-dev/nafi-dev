While the primary focus is on showcasing the architecture and benefits of creating a custom component library, it also ensures a streamlined development process with ready-to-use components. The library is designed to help developers avoid the common pitfalls of personalizing existing UI libraries and ensures better performance, scalability, and maintainability by including only what is needed for the project.</p><h4 id="why-and-when" tabindex="-1">Why and when? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-and-when" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why and when?&quot;">​</a></h4><p>When a client has a specific UI in mind, creating a custom component library can be a much more effective solution than relying on existing UI libraries. While it might seem easier to leverage pre-built libraries, developers often end up spending a significant amount of time trying to personalize them. This process leads to bloated, inefficient code that’s difficult to maintain, scale, and read—often resulting in a frustrating development experience.</p><h4 id="benefits" tabindex="-1">Benefits <a class="header-anchor" href="#benefits" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Benefits&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Building a custom component library provides several benefits:</p><ul><li> Better Performance: By including only the components you truly need, you can eliminate unnecessary overhead and optimize your application’s performance. </li><li> Scalability and Maintainability: Tailoring the library to your project&#39;s unique needs results in cleaner, more modular code that’s easier to maintain and expand over time. </li><li> Client Ownership: As a bonus, your client may choose to sell the library to others, opening up potential additional revenue streams. </li></ul><h4 id="our-architecture" tabindex="-1">Our architecture <a class="header-anchor" href="#our-architecture" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Our architecture&quot;">​</a></h4><p>For this project, we used a monorepo architecture. A monorepo is ideal when multiple projects or packages need to share common code, and you want to manage them in a single repository. It’s particularly useful when:</p><ul><li> Multiple projects are being developed simultaneously (e.g., the component library, main application, docs, tests, and related services). </li><li> Consistency across projects is important, ensuring that all parts of the system use the same version of shared dependencies. </li><li> Centralized management is required, allowing easy updates and testing across all parts of the codebase from one location. </li></ul><p>To handle the scalability challenges and complexity of maintaining a large component library, we opted to use Hygen as a code generator. This allows us to automate the process of creating new components. When we run the script to create a new component, it automatically generates the necessary files (Vue component, story component for Histoire, and the docs for the component) so we don&#39;t forget any of the steps. This ensures that our development process is consistent and efficient.</p><p>Additionally, we used Changesets to manage the changelogs and VitePress to handle the documentation pages. This combination helps us keep track of versioning and ensures that our documentation is always up to date.</p><p>By opting for a monorepo and using tools like Hygen, Changesets, and VitePress, we were able to streamline the development process, simplify dependency management, and maintain a high level of consistency across all parts of the project.</p><h3 id="tech-stack" tabindex="-1">Tech stack <a class="header-anchor" href="#tech-stack" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tech stack&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>Vue.js</li><li>TypeScript</li><li>Tailwind CSS &amp; Daisy UI</li><li>PNPM</li></ul><h3 id="links" tabindex="-1">Links <a class="header-anchor" href="#links" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Links&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Docs</strong>: <a href="#">Custom Component Library</a></li></ul>',17)),t("h2",h,[e[4]||(e[4]=a("Fullstack Product Management App ")),o(i,{type:"warning",text:"in dev"}),e[5]||(e[5]=a()),o(i,{type:"tip",text:"Release: Q1 2025"}),e[6]||(e[6]=a()),e[7]||(e[7]=t("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#fullstack-product-management-app","aria-label":'Permalink to "Fullstack Product Management App <Badge type="warning" text="in dev" /> <Badge type="tip" text="Release: Q1 2025" />"'},"​",-1))]),e[17]||(e[17]=n('<h3 id="description-1" tabindex="-1">Description <a class="header-anchor" href="#description-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Description&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is an open-source, full-featured product management app built with and for the Vue ecosystem.
